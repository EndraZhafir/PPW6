                    A heart that's full up like a landfill. A job that slowly kills you. Bruises that won't heal.
                    You look so tired, unhappy. Bring down the government. They don't, they don't speak for us. I'll take
                    a quiet life. A handshake of carbon monoxide. And no alarms and no surprises. No alarms and no surprises.
                    No alarms and no surprises. Silent. Silent. This is my final fit, my final bellyache with no alarms and no
                    surprises. No alarms and no surprises. No alarms and no surprises please. Such a pretty house and such a pretty
                    garden. No alarms and no surprises. No alarms and no surprises. No alarms and no surprises please.
